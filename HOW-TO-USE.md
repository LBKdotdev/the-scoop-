# Scoop Tracker — How To Use

Open the app on your phone or computer: **http://localhost:8000**

You'll see 4 tabs at the top: **Dashboard**, **Production**, **Count**, **Flavors**

---

## Step 1: Log Production (when you make a batch)

Every time you make ice cream, log it right away.

1. Tap the **Production** tab
2. Pick the **flavor** from the dropdown list
3. Tap the **product type** — Tub, Pint, or Quart
4. Use the **+ and −** buttons to set how many you made
5. Tap **LOG PRODUCTION**

Done. Do this every time you make a batch — takes about 5 seconds.

---

## Step 2: Nightly Count (before closing)

This replaces the paper tally sheet. Do this every night before you close.

1. Tap the **Count** tab
2. You'll see every flavor with a number already filled in — that's the app's best guess based on what you had yesterday, what you made today, and how much you usually sell
3. Walk the case and freezer:
   - If the number is right, **skip it**
   - If the number is wrong, tap **+ or −** to fix it
4. You can filter by **category** or **type** (Tubs / Pints / Quarts) using the dropdowns at the top to make it faster
5. When everything looks right, tap **SUBMIT ALL COUNTS**

That's it. Most numbers will already be close, so you're mainly just confirming.

## Step 3: Check the Dashboard (anytime)

The **Dashboard** tab shows you everything at a glance.

- **Alerts** — Red means almost out, yellow means running low. Make more of those flavors.
- **Current Inventory** — Table showing how many tubs, pints, and quarts you have of each flavor. Green = good, orange = getting low, red = out.
- **Flavor Popularity** — Bar chart showing your best sellers for the week
- **Production vs Consumption** — Are you making too much or too little of each flavor?

---

## Step 4: AI Insights (optional)

On the Dashboard, tap **GENERATE INSIGHTS** to get smart suggestions like:

- What to make tomorrow and how much
- Which flavors are trending up or down
- If you're wasting any flavors (making more than you sell)

---

## Adding a New Flavor

1. Tap the **Flavors** tab
2. Type the flavor name
3. Pick a category (Classics, Fruity, Chocolate, etc.)
4. Tap **ADD FLAVOR**

It'll show up everywhere — production, counts, dashboard.

---

## Removing a Flavor

1. Tap the **Flavors** tab
2. Find the flavor and tap **Archive**

It won't show up in counts anymore, but the old data is still saved.

## Voice Input (Count Tab)

Instead of tapping +/− on every item, you can call them out by voice. Tap the **Voice Input** button on the Count tab and speak naturally.

### What to say

**One item at a time:**
> "Vanilla pint four"
> "Four pints of vanilla"
> "Chocolate chip tub one"

Flavor, size, and number in any order — all three are required.

**Multiple items, mixed sizes** — use "and" between them:
> "Vanilla pint four and chocolate quart seven and chocolate chip tub one"

**Multiple items, same size** — fastest format:
> "Tubs: nine chocolate chip, four vanilla, two strawberry"
> "Pints: four vanilla, seven chocolate"

Say the size once, then list flavors with numbers separated by commas.

### Set vs. Add

- **Saying a number alone** → sets the count to that number (replaces what's there)
- **Saying "add", "also", "found", "plus", or "more"** → adds to the existing count

> "Found three vanilla pints" — bumps the current count up by 3
> "Vanilla pint three" — sets it to 3

### After you speak

A confirmation screen shows what the app parsed. Review it, then tap **Confirm** to apply. You can remove any wrong entries before confirming.

Say **"undo"** to reverse the last voice entry if you catch a mistake.

## Tips

- **You don't need to be perfect.** Close counts are fine — the app gets smarter over time.
- **Log production right when you make it.** Don't wait until end of day.
- **Check alerts before you start making ice cream.** It tells you what's running low.
- **The app works on any phone.** No app to download — just open it in your browser.
